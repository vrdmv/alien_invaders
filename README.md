# alien_invaders
The classic arcade game where a ship has to shoot down a group of aliens, but they get quicker with each level. 
The player has 3 ships available and can shoot only 3 bullets at a time. There is also a scoreboard and level indicator. 
In order to play, the player has to simply run alien_invasion.py, while making sure they have downloaded all the modules
contained within this repository.
